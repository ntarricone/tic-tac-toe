# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built with React, Vite, and TypeScript.

## Overview

This project implements a Tic Tac Toe game with a 3x3 grid, where two players take turns placing their marks (X and O) on the board. The game checks for a winner after each move and displays a congratulatory modal in case of victory. If there is no winner and the board is full, it shows a modal indicating a draw. Note it's only a front end implemantation, no multiplayer is allowed.
